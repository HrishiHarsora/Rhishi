# Rhishi
I am Hrishi Harsora, a sophomore in the department of Materials Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (IITGN). 

I work with various materials and/or several architectures such as Heterojunctions, 2D Materials, etc not only through experiments but also (predominantly) probe them through computational approaches such as Density Functional Theory, Molecular Dynamics, etc.

Previously, I have worked with Prof. Alok Shukla of the department of Physics at IIT Bombay on Density Functional Theory calculations of novel 2D Materials, namely Graphene, hexagonal Boron Nitride, Silicene, Phosphorene and Silicon Carbide, during the summer of my first year (2024). Although, in hindsight, the calculations I performed back then were trivial, the theoretical foundations of DFT that I developed during that first exposure to the field of computational materials science have been invaluable. 

Currently I am working with Prof. Anagh Bhaumik of the department of Materials Science and Engineering on Silicon based photodetectors. 

**Update:** **Beginning from Spring 2025, I am starting a project with Prof. Tiju Thomas of the department of Metallurigical and Materials Engineering at IIT Madras where I'll be probing novel heterostructures for their electronic properties. **

Apart from working with materials through (mainly) a computational approach and occasionally through experiments, I hold an interest in motorsports and follow the various events taking place.

As a sidequest, I helped start Moksha Motorsports, IIT Gandhinagar's inaugral racing team! 

I am also amazed by the night sky and like reading and probing through telescopes the vast abyss around us.
